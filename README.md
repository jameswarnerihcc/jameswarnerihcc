- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m James. I'm a experienced software engineer with a passion for education. I work as a Computer Software Development instructor at Indian Hills Community College (IHCC) in Ottumwa, Iowa. My goal is create helpful resources for my students and students of the software world alike. I'm a little biased, but I think we have one of the greatest 2-year programs at a very competitive cost! Check out the program here: [IHCC Computer Software Development](https://www.indianhills.edu/academics/tech/computer_softwaredev.php)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on developing our Cloud courses (AWS, Google Cloud) and enriching our Web Development and Java courses. Here on GitHub students get to explore familarity with Git concepts, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and deploying code to cloud environments.
